# FactCheck

This is a pet project to fact check viral media and be able to flag them and optionally suggest alternative recommendation for it's authentic news. (Misinformation killer)


I am looking at the following papers for reference which have done considerable work in Fake news detection or misinformation detection
https://github.com/dipbanik/FactCheck/tree/main/Ref_Papers


Probable dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset
Hugging Face datasets - Liar dataset. - https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/tree/master/datasets/liar
Additional from papers - 
(e.g., CREDBANK [Mitra and Gilbert 2015], LIAR [Wang
2017], FakeNewsNet [Shu et al. 2018], FakevsSatire [Golbeck et al. 2018], NELA-GT-2018 [NÃ¸rregaard et al. 2019],
FEVER [Thorne et al. 2018], PHEME [Kochkina et al. 2018], and Emergent [Ferreira and Vlachos 2016]) and systems
that can be used for building datasets (e.g., ClaimBuster [Hassan et al. 2017b], XFake [Yang et al. 2019], Hoaxy [Shao
et al. 2016], MediaRank [Ye and Skiena 2019], Botometer [Davis et al. 2016], and RumorLens [Resnick et al. 2014]
